# British Airways Data Science Project ✈️

This project was completed as part of the **Forage Virtual Experience** with British Airways.  
It covers **predictive modeling of customer bookings** using machine learning.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Exploration:** Analyzed customer booking dataset (purchase lead, trip type, channels, add-ons, etc.)
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features like booking lead buckets, add-on counts, and region mapping
- **Modeling:** Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict booking completion
- **Evaluation:** Achieved ROC AUC ~0.XX (cross-validated)
- **Interpretability:** Identified top predictive features (purchase lead, trip type, add-ons)
- **Presentation:** Summarized findings in a PowerPoint slide

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- PowerPoint (`python-pptx`)
